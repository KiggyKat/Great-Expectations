My dream job at this point in life is a game developer.
I've always liked making stories, coming up with the characters and the story arcs. Later in life, I was introduced into HTML which took me down a rabbit hole of finding ways to add visuals to my stories; make them more interesting. Since then I've slowly been working my way up the ladder, learning different programming languages and everything I can to eventually become a game developer.
Changes for assignment.
